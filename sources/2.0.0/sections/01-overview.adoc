== Overview

S-104 is the Water Level Information for Surface Navigation Product
Specification, produced by the IHO. This edition of S-104 is intended
for use with the "water level adjustment" functionality described
in IHO Publication <<IHO_S_98>>.

The development of electronic navigation with high resolution bathymetric
data, and the drive to increase safety of navigation are now demanding
time-sensitive data. IHO has identified the requirement for a Product
Specification for dynamic tidal and water level data.

Tidal height information has traditionally been provided as high/low
predictions; however, with increasing drafts and technology, there
has been a move to hourly or more frequent predictions with major
ports providing real-time water level information to their pilots
and web-sites.

In order to allow applications to dynamically adjust depths, there
is a requirement for S-104 Edition 2.0.0 to supply water level data
as gridded surface time-series data compatible with the IHO <<IHO_S_102>>
(Bathymetric Surface) and <<IHO_S_101>> (Electronic Navigation Chart)
data products.

[[sec_1.1]]
=== Introduction

Tidal and water level predictions have been fundamental in route planning
and entry to ports (SOLAS Chapter V). These have traditionally been
supplied as a physical hard copy publication and recently as a separate
software installation that may not be integrated with the ECDIS. New
functionality is now being defined to integrate dynamic water level
information into ECDIS. To improve safety of navigation, this product
specification will ensure that tidal and water level data supplied
for dynamic capability is consistent by all approved authorities.

Annex C of IHO Publication <<IHO_S_98>> describes ECDIS functionality
for combining dynamic water level information with bathymetric data
to present ship's officers with a more accurate picture of water depth
over an interval. Given the technological ability to generate short-term
dynamic forecasts of water level information and communicate them
to vessels more frequently, this allows provision of more timely and
accurate look-ahead depth information which can be used for more accurate
estimation of navigability and hazard assessment by ship's officers
and watchstanders.

[[sec_1.1.1]]
==== Data types

This edition of S-104 describes one data type that can be delivered
to recipients such as ECDIS or other applications, either on board
a vessel or in a shore installation:

A time series of water level height relative to a vertical datum and
water level trend. The data represent an array of points contained
in a grid. Time and datum information are contained in the metadata.
The primary purpose of this data type is to enable displays of dynamic
depth information on ECDIS in combination with bathymetric data; another
purpose is to update water depths for under-keel clearance management.

[[sec_1.1.2]]
==== Display

This edition of S-104 is designed for a single means of displaying
water level data to support navigation, route planning, and route
monitoring:

* Adjusted display of depths from datasets containing bathymetric
data or electronic nautical chart information. This will be described
in <<IHO_S_98,annex=C>>.

[[sec_1.1.3]]
==== Encoding

There is one encoding of water level data:

1. HDF5 (Hierarchical Data Format version 5) is used for encoding
time series of water level heights and trends (and optionally, uncertainty)
at an array of points in a grid. HDF5 promotes compatible data exchange
due to its common neutral encoding format. HDF5 is object oriented
and suitable for many types of data.

<<table_1-1>> summarises Clauses <<sec_1.1.1,droploc%>> through <<sec_1.1.3,droploc%>>.

=== Scope

This document describes an S-100 compliant Product Specification for
the encapsulation and data transfer of tidal and water level data
for use in an Electronic Chart Display and Information System (ECDIS)
or any proposed dynamic tide application. This Product Specification
includes the content model, the encoding, the feature catalogue and
metadata. The water level product may be used either alone or combined
with other S-100 compatible data.

_green_ which belongs to the *data type* _text_

[example]
A *feature attribute* named _length_ may have an *attribute* value
_82.4_ which belongs to the *data type* _real_

NOTE: A *feature attribute* may occur as a *type* or an *instance*.
*Feature attribute* type or *feature attribute* instance is used when
only one is meant.

NOTE: A *feature attribute* type has a name, a *data type*, and a
{{ domain }} associated to it. A *feature attribute* instance has
an *attribute* value taken from the {{ domain }} of the *feature attribute*

the interval (about a given value) that will contain the true value
of the measurement at a specific confidence level

[.source]
<<IHO_S_44>>

NOTE: Errors exist and are the differences between the measured value
and the true value. Since the true value is never known it follows
that the error itself cannot be known. Uncertainty is a statistical
assessment of the likely magnitude of this error.

===== water level trend

change of water level at a given time, such as 'increasing', 'decreasing',
or 'steady'.

When the average change of the water level over a one hour period
is greater than or equal to a value set by the Producing Authority
in metres it is considered "increasing". When it is less than or equal
to -(value set by the Producing Authority in metres), it is "decreasing".
When it is between the values set by the Producing Authority, it is
"steady".

In areas of small water level range, for example Baltic Sea, use of
"not available" is optional

===== ungeorectified grid

grid with non-uniform point spacing in any coordinate system. Includes
triangular irregular networks (TINs) and those curvilinear coordinate
grids whose node positions cannot be calculated analytically

===== vertical coordinate system

one-dimensional coordinate system used for gravity-related height
or depth measurements

[.source]
<<ISO_19111_2003>>

===== vertical datum

datum describing the relation of gravity-related heights or depths
to the Earth

NOTE: In most cases the vertical datum will be related to mean sea
level. Ellipsoidal heights are treated as related to a three-dimensional
ellipsoidal coordinate system referenced to a geodetic datum. Vertical
datums include sounding datums (used for hydrographic purposes), in
which case the heights may be negative heights or depths

==== Notation

In this document conceptual schemas are presented in the Unified Modelling
Language (UML). Several model elements used in this schema are defined
in ISO Standards developed by ISO TC 211, or in IHO S-100. In order
to ensure that class names in the model are unique ISO TC/211 has
adopted a convention of establishing a prefix to the names of classes
that define the TC/211 defined UML package in which the UML class
is defined. Since the IHO Standards and this Product Specification
make use of classes derived directly from the ISO Standards this convention
is also followed here. In the IHO Standards the class names are identified
by the name of the Standard, such as "_S100_" as the prefix optionally
followed by the bialpha prefix derived from ISO. For the classes defined
in this Product Specification the prefix is _"S104"._ In order to
avoid having multiple classes instantiating the same root classes,
the ISO classes and S-100 classes have been used where possible; however,
a new instantiated class is required if there is a need to alter a
class or relationship to prevent a reverse coupling between the model
elements introduced in this document and those defined in S-100 or
the ISO model.

[[sec_1.7.1.1]]
===== Introduction

Changes to S-104 will be released by the IHO as a New Edition, revision,
or clarification.

[[sec_1.7.1.2]]
===== New Edition

_New Editions_ of S-104 introduce significant changes. _New Editions_
enable new concepts, such as the ability to support new functions
or applications, or the introduction of new constructs or data types.
_New Editions_ are likely to have a significant impact on either existing
users or future users of S-104. All cumulative _revisions_ and _clarifications_
must be included with the release of approved New Editions.

[[sec_1.7.1.3]]
===== Revision

_Revisions_ are defined as substantive semantic changes to S-104.
Typically, _revisions_ will change S-104 to correct factual errors;
introduce necessary changes that have become evident as a result of
practical experience or changing circumstances. A _revision_ must
not be classified as a clarification. _Revisions_ could have an impact
on either existing users or future users of S-104. All cumulative
_clarifications_ must be included with the release of approved revisions.

Changes in a revision are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition. Newer revisions,
for example, introduce new features and attributes. Within the same
Edition, a dataset of one version could always be processed with a
later version of the Feature and Portrayal Catalogues.

In most cases a new Feature Catalogue will result in a revision of
S-104.

[[sec_1.7.1.4]]
===== Clarification

_Clarifications_ are non-substantive changes to S-104. Typically,
_clarifications_: remove ambiguity; correct grammatical and spelling
errors; amend or update cross references; and insert improved graphics.
A _clarification_ must not cause any substantive semantic change to
S-104.

Changes in a _clarification_ are minor and ensure backward compatibility
with the previous versions within the same Edition.

[[sec_1.7.1.5]]
===== Version numbers

The associated version control numbering to identify changes (n) to
S-104 must be as follows:
