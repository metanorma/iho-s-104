== Portrayal

The display of gridded water level data is controlled by the underlying
ENC or bathymetry product because S-104 data is used to adjust depth
and uncertainty values in those products. This edition of S-104 therefore
does not provide a portrayal catalogue or describe symbology. Further,
the only interoperability functionalities described by S-98 which
apply to S-104 are those pertaining to water level adjustment. These
functionalities are described in S-98 Annex C.

NOTE: Specification of the algorithm for adjustment of bathymetry
data or ENC feature data is outside the scope of this Product Specification.
It is described in S-98.

NOTE: There are no specifications for the display of a water surface
from gridded data as a distinct layer in this Product Specification
Edition.
