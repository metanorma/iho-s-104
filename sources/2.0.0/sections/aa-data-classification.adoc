=== Feature Attributes

The number of attributes for _Water Level_ is three: water level height,
water level trend, and uncertainty. Encoding remarks are included
with each attribute specification, below.

. Water Level Height (_waterLevelHeight_)
+
--
[cols=1,options="unnumbered"]
|===
a| *Water Level Height:* The height of a water surface relative to
a vertical datum

[underline]#Unit:# metre (m)

[underline]#Maximum Resolution:# 0.01 m

[underline]#Format:# xxx.xx

[underline]#Example:# *10.54*

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Land mask or missing value is denoted by a unique number as specified
in the metadata.
* The height is relative to some vertical datum, which is defined
in the metadata.
* 0.01 metres equals 0.3937 inches (1 cm).
|===
--

. Water Level Trend (_waterLevelTrend_)
+
--
[cols=1,options="unnumbered"]
|===
a| *Water Level Trend:* The tendency of water level to change in a
particular direction.

1:: Decreasing (_decreasing_)
2:: Increasing (_increasing_)
3:: Steady (_steady_)

[underline]#Unit:# none (enumeration)

[underline]#Resolution:# N/A (enumeration)

[underline]#Format:# x

[underline]#Example:# *3* (Steady)

[underline]#Remarks:#

* To determine category, use metadata variable _waterLevelTrendThreshold_
(See <<table_12-1>>):

** Decreasing: trend <= -__waterLevelTrendThreshold__
** Increasing: trend >= +__waterLevelTrendThreshold__
* Steady: -_waterLevelTrendThreshold_ < trend < +_waterLevelTrendThreshold_
Where a value is not known, the fill value must be populated, which
is _0_ (Unknown). The fill value may be used in non-tidal or similar
regions.

* Native integer type H5T_STD_U8LE should be used for the base type
of the numeric code (_1_, _2_, or _3_ here) when creating the enumeration.
|===
--

. *Uncertainty (_uncertainty_)*
+
--
[cols=1,options="unnumbered"]
|===
a| *Uncertainty:* Estimate characterising the range of values within
which the true value of a measurement is expected to lie as defined
within a particular confidence level. It is expressed as a positive
value.

[underline]#Unit:# metre (m)

[underline]#Resolution:# 0.01 metre

[underline]#Format:# xx.xx

[underline]#Example:# *0.02*

[underline]#Remarks:#

* Represents a +/- value defining the possible range of associated
water level height, expressed as a positive number. For example, 0.02
represents +/- 0.02 m uncertainty in water level height.
* Represents the uncertainty at a particular grid point and may be
omitted if the uncertainty is the same at all grid points.
* If the water level height for a particular values record is the
fill value, the uncertainty in that record must be the uncertainty
fill value.
